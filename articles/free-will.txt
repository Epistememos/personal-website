<h1> Thoughts on Free Will </h1>

<h3> TLDR: Free will is what should matter the most to us and we should not only believe in it but also implement the assumption of its existence in our lives. </h3>

<h2> DETERMINISM: </h2>
<p> Determinism is the belief that events are predetermined by their cause. And so, causes are also predetermined since they are events. One of the best illustrations of determinism would be science. With science, we have information as input and we apply a method to derive a probable output. E.G. If an object is thrown upwards, it will reach the ground in a calculated amount of seconds based on its height, initial velocity, and the forces applied to it. Scientists know that their methods are only approximations. Different models yield different results, but no model can predict results with an accuracy of 100%. </p> 

<h2> LAPLACE’S DEMON: </h2>
<p>Here’s an interesting thought experiment on casual determinism: Laplace’s Demon
Laplace postulated that if an entity knew of the position and momentum of every particle of the universe, then such an entity would be able to derive the past and predict the future from the laws of classical mechanics. If you think about it, your mind is made up of different particles with different velocities and their interaction produces your thoughts and actions. And so, according to this thought experiment, your behavior could be completely predicted. Fortunately, Laplace’s thought experiment falls apart when considering the irreversibility of quantum mechanics and thermodynamics to derive the past from the present. On top of that, from our current understanding of quantum mechanics, the momentum and position of an object cannot be completely known by Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle. Finally, this entity would not even be possible because it could never compute an infinite amount of information. </p>

<h2> FREE WILL </h2>
<p> So you might think that we have free will! Well, no. Even if the world is uncertain, it doesn’t mean that we can act upon it. 
So how do we prove free will?
Well, we don’t. We assume it to be existing. We believe in it.
Why?
Philosophers have often tortured themselves in the quest for truth. From a rational standpoint, philosophy should only concern itself with truth and proving it.
I disagree. I think that philosophy should be used for our betterment. Philosophy should be pragmatic. And to be pragmatic, philosophy should suit the individual. I believe in a phenomenological approach to philosophy, one that centers around the experience of the individual. As such, philosophy doesn’t tell me what is true, it tells me what is best.
Now, how does this belief apply to free will?
Since philosophy should serve the purpose of bettering our existence, questions like: “Do we have free will?” become meaningless. Instead, we should ask: “Should free will exist?” 
Let’s analyze that!
For the sake of simplification, not believing in free will means that you believe in determinism.
I will consider three simplified alternatives: </p>
<li> We have no free will, so we are fully determined; </li>
<li> We have some free will, so we are partially determined; </li>
<li> We have complete free will. </li>


<h2> NO FREE WILL </h2>
<p> The idea implies that we are fully determined. What is the point of this thought?
Well, you believe that all of your thoughts are predetermined, including your belief in determinism. From this perspective, you are set to live a predetermined life and have no choice in anything. You’re simply a fact from the universe. If you were to apply this belief to your current life, you might see yourself as an observer. But what’s the point of being an observer if the thoughts on the things you observe are part of the observed (thoughts are predetermined and so are your thoughts on the observed) </p>

<h2> HALF & HALF (Or different ratio of free will/determinism) </h2>
<p> The idea implies that you have a certain degree to influence a predetermined event. Free will entails that you can change the “fate” of events a bit. Although it seems like a good consensus to reach as it implies that there are some things we can control and others not, it is not the most pragmatic one as it is very hard to determine what you can control. For example, say you have a challenge to complete that you find very hard. You think it is impossible to solve, but really, it’s just that you haven’t worked enough to find a possible solution. In your mind, you might think that this problem is predetermined to be impossible to solve because of some reason (I’m not smart enough, this problem is too complex to be solved by a human, this problem is simply not logical, etc.), but really, it’s just that you have not made the efforts to reach that solution. Determinism becomes a scapegoat when your will is not strong enough. This is why I think it is necessary to think that you have all the free will. </p>

<h2> COMPLETE FREE WILL </h2>
<p> Complete free will implies that you control everything in your life. Although that might not be true, you should believe that it is. That way, you cannot use determinism as a scapegoat and you become responsible for every event in your life. What allows you to “forge” those events comes down to how strong your free will is. Thinking like this might cause some problems. For example, could you blame someone’s terminal illness for their lack of free will? No. But this philosophy is not about blame, it’s about seeing what you can do yourself, it’s about removing the limits of the possible to yourself. Another example, what if I want to jump to the moon without using anything? Are you telling me that if I have enough free will, I would be able to do that? Yes! But then, is this the best use of your free will? I think that free will is hard to cultivate, it takes a mental strength to be able to say: I possess and make the choice. Especially if you think that other agents in the universe might also have free will. What if two free wills conflict? In that sense, you need to understand how strong your free will is and how to best use it. If your life obsession is to jump to the moon without using anything, then you can try your hardest at it, but, for most, it probably isn’t. This isn’t an absolute philosophy, it doesn’t dictate how you should behave, it’s there to make you say: “I can do it”. </p>
